# Atlarge PhD Thesis Template


This is an modified version of the [Improved TU Delft PhD thesis
template](https://github.com/Inventitech/phd-thesis-template). It
features a large number of changes to increase both on- and off-screen
(printing) quality, as well as reduce printing costs. It is a
double-sided, colored dissertation style with hyperlinks.

## Setup and Installation

See the original [README](README.txt).

There are three document options to the provided dissertation.cls style -- be sure to use `print` when sending to the printer.

Mac users will have to install the Libertinus and Inconsolata fonts on their systems.

## Version

This template is based on commit `ff9d073` of TU Delft's template
(dissertation template from July 2nd, 2015, strangely referred to in
the TeX document as '2013/07/08 v1.0 TU Delft dissertation class'),
which was the latest available on 13-11-2018. Unfortunately, I did not
have access to their repository.
